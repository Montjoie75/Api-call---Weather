# Api-call---Weather

This very small app allows the user to get the current temperature of any city in the world. The data is fetched from the Openweather API.

To use this app, you will need to register to https://openweathermap.org/ and get an API key.

Once done, after installing the project on your machine, open the App.js file and simply assign the value to the appKey constant variable, entering your API key in between brackets, like this: 

    const appKey = "enter your API key here"
